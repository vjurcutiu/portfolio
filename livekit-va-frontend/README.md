# Voice Assistant Frontend

A minimalistic React frontend application for interacting with [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents).


The best way to test this application is by using the [LiveKit Sandbox](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox). 

## Development Setup
Add the necessary environment variables to connect to your LiveKit server. If you are using **LiveKit Cloud**, you can find the required environment variables in your project settings [here](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/settings/keys).

```shell
# Ensure all dependencies are installed.
pnpm install

# Start the local development server.
pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
```
